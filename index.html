              <p class="">This September, 30 organisational hackers and innovators will gather for 4 days in the beautiful Belgian countryside. Enspiral Org Academy is a unique training in future ways of working: ways that are more human, self-managing, non-hierarchical, agile and deliberately developmental.<br><br>

Many of us know that “business as usual” in our organisations and workplaces is not sustainable anymore. We want to introduce new ways of working and learn to lead in a new paradigm way - but it’s difficult to find out how to do that.<br><br>


Many have read the books - Reinventing Organisations by Fredric Laloux or Brave New Work by Aaron Dignan - but few have lived the experience. How do I build a team or company that is self-managing and non-hierarchical but doesn’t descend into chaos? How do I lead in a way that is more horizontal and less top-down?<br><br>


Join us at this immersive training and retreat to learn new things, practice different patterns, meet fellow The Enspiral Org Academy is for people who are already working in non-hierarchical environments, or just starting their journey into self-management. You might be a founder, coach, manager, organisational designer, or community builder.</p>

This training will strengthen, accelerate and deepen what you have begun. You will learn practices to help you where you are stuck.<br><br>Perhaps you are an employee, founder or manager and you want to find out ways you can encourage your team to be more engaged, have more agency, and freedom.</p>
